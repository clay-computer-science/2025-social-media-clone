# 2025 Social Media Clone

Our goal is to create a fully functional social media app.

Users should be able to:
- Scroll through content
- Follow, react, and comment on posts
- Upload content
- Download content
- Tag other users
- Message other users via private messages

## Overview

This project will be divided into 3 phases:
- Phase 0 - Learning
- Phase 1 - Basic Functionality
- Phase 2 - Full Web Application
- Phase 3 - Mobile Application

Phases 1 and 2 will use a framework called Next.js while Phase 3 will use a framework called expo. More information about these frameworks can be found in the resources section.

## Getting Started

### Next.js

In order to get the code running for the Next.js application, start here.

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js v20+
- NPM v11+
- Git

**Cloning**

You can clone this repo with the following command:

Open the folder you want to clone the repo to, hold shift, right click, and select *Open in Terminal*.
Type the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/clay-computer-science/2025-social-media-clone.git
```

Now drag the folder created by this command onto your desktop icon for VSCode or WebStorm.

Inside the project folder, run the following command:
```shell
npm install
```

**Starting Development Server**

To start the dev server, run the following command inside the project folder:
```shell
npm run dev
```

## Phase 0

Before we start trying to build an application its important to understand what we're doing.
Phase 0 will be a period of independent research. You will be building simple sites and learning how React and Next.js work.
To get started, check out the resources section for some good starting points, but feel free to watch other content.

## Phase 1

Our goal in phase 1 is to get the barebones app working. It doesn't have to be pretty, just somewhat functional.

By the end of phase 1, our application should allow users to:
- Scroll through content
- Follow other users
- Create posts
- Like posts

## Phase 2

Our goal in phase 2 is to finish the web application. By the end, our application should look and act polished as well as include all the features defined at the top.

## Phase 3

Our goal in phase 3 is to make a companion mobile app that mirrors the functionality of our web app. During phase 3, the web application can still be worked on, but the end goal is to have a mobile app that has feature parity with the web app.

## Resources

### Next.js and React

I strongly recommend the channel [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution).
He makes tons of content about the technologies we'll be using throughout this project.

Here are some playlists to get you started:
- [ReactJS Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3)
- [React Hooks Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwisvxhZ135pogtX7_Oe3Q3A)
- [Next.js 15 Tutorial - Beginner to Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhIEc4I4YsRz5C7GOBnxSJY)

I would recommend starting with the first playlist: ReactJS Tutorial for Beginners.
This will teach you the basics of how React works. The first 43 videos are important for understanding the concepts required to use React.
We will be primarily be using functional components with hooks, so most of your time should be spent learning these paradigms. These are discussed in depth in the React Hooks Tutorial playlist.
You will notice that all the videos in React Hooks Tutorial are in ReactJS Tutorial for Beginners, but there are other videos mixed in which are not recommended.

Once you understand React, then you can work on learning Next.js. The Next.js 15 Tutorial is a great place to start.

### Expo

For now, you should avoid Expo. Expo is based on React Native, a modified framework React built for mobile app development. Learning the concepts of React will translate pretty directly to developing with Expo and React Native.

There are some differences, but these will be discussed when starting Phase 3.
